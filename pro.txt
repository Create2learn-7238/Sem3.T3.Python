Got it — you want **bigger, more meaningful projects** that still only need *basic Python* (loops, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, functions, maybe files). Let’s level up 🚀

## 🌟 Intermediate Beginner Python Project Ideas

### 1. **Student Report Card System**
- Input student names and marks for subjects.  
- Calculate total, average, grade (A/B/C).  
- Save results in a text file.  
- Add search functionality to look up a student’s record.

---

### 2. **Library Management (Text-based)**
- Keep track of books (title, author, availability).  
- Borrow/return books by updating status.  
- Show all available books.  
- Store data in a dictionary or file.

---

### 3. **Expense Tracker**
- User enters daily expenses (food, travel, etc.).  
- Program calculates total and category-wise spending.  
- Optionally save to a file for monthly tracking.  
- Add a simple summary report.

---

### 4. **Contact Book**
- Store names, phone numbers, and emails.  
- Add, delete, update, and search contacts.  
- Save contacts in a file so they persist.  
- Use dictionaries for quick lookups.

### 5. **Basic Banking System**
- Create accounts with balance.  
- Deposit, withdraw, transfer money between accounts.  
- Show account details.  
- Store data in a file or dictionary.

---

### 6. **Quiz App with Scoreboard**
- Multiple-choice questions stored in a file/dictionary.  
- User answers, program checks correctness.  
- Keep track of scores for multiple players.  
- Show leaderboard at the end.

---

### 7. **Simple Chatbot**
- Predefined responses for certain keywords.  
- Example: If user types “hello”, bot replies “Hi there!”.  
- Expand with more rules.  
- Great way to practice conditionals and string handling.

### 8. **Text-Based Adventure RPG**
- Player has health, inventory, and choices.  
- Encounters enemies, finds items, makes decisions.  
- Use `if`/`else` to branch storylines.  
- Add save/load feature with files.

---

### 9. **Weather Logger (Manual Input)**
- User enters daily temperature.  
- Program calculates weekly average, highest, lowest.  
- Store data in a file.  
- Later, you can connect to real APIs.

---

### 10. **Mini E-Commerce Simulation**
- List of products with prices.  
- User can “add to cart”, “remove”, “checkout”.  
- Calculate total bill.  
- Store purchase history in a file.

👉 These are **larger projects** that can take days/weeks to build, but still rely only on Python basics.  

Would you like me to **pick one (like Expense Tracker or Library System) and outline the step-by-step plan with code structure** so you can start building it?
